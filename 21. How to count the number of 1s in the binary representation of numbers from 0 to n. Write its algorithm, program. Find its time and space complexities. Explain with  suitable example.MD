# üßÆ Count the Number of 1s in the Binary Representation of Numbers from 0 to n

## ‚úÖ Problem Statement

Given a number `n`, count the number of `1`s in the binary representation of all numbers from `0` to `n`.

## üß† Algorithm (Optimized Approach)

### Key Insight:
The problem can be solved efficiently by recognizing a pattern in the binary representation of numbers. Instead of iterating over each number and counting the `1`s individually, we can use an efficient approach that leverages dynamic programming.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**:
   - We will use an array `dp[]` where `dp[i]` stores the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the number `i`.
   - `dp[i]` can be derived from the formula:
     ```
     dp[i] = dp[i >> 1] + (i & 1)
     ```
     Where `i >> 1` is the number `i` shifted right by 1 (which is the number without its least significant bit), and `(i & 1)` checks if the least significant bit is `1`.

2. **Iterate from 1 to n**:
   - For each number `i`, compute the number of `1`s using the formula above and add it to a running total.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - The total number of `1`s for numbers from `0` to `n` is the sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[n]`.

## üíª Java Program

```java
public class CountOnesInBinary {

    public static int countOnes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        // Iterate over all numbers from 0 to n
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            // Count the number of 1s in the binary representation of i
            count += Integer.bitCount(i);
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5;
        System.out.println("Count of 1s in binary representations from 0 to " + n + ": " + countOnes(n));
    }
}
```

## üìå Example

### Input:
```
n = 5
```

### Process:
- We need to count the number of `1`s in the binary representations of numbers from `0` to `5`.

1. **Binary Representations**:
   ```
   0 -> 0
   1 -> 1
   2 -> 10
   3 -> 11
   4 -> 100
   5 -> 101
   ```

2. **Count of `1`s in each binary number**:
   - `0`: 0 `1`s
   - `1`: 1 `1`
   - `2`: 1 `1`
   - `3`: 2 `1`s
   - `4`: 1 `1`
   - `5`: 2 `1`s

3. **Total Count of `1`s**:
   - `0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7`

### ‚úÖ Output:
```
Count of 1s in binary representations from 0 to 5: 7
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

| Operation            | Complexity     |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Time                 | O(n)           |
| Space                | O(1)           |

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the input number. We loop from `0` to `n` and use the `Integer.bitCount()` function for each number, which has a time complexity of O(1) due to the number of bits being constant (32-bit integers).
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a few variables to store intermediate results and the total count. The space required does not grow with `n`.

## üìö Summary

The problem of counting the number of `1`s in the binary representation of all numbers from `0` to `n` can be efficiently solved by using the built-in `Integer.bitCount()` function, which counts the number of `1`s in a number‚Äôs binary representation. This approach allows us to iterate through the numbers from `0` to `n` and accumulate the result in linear time, O(n), with constant space complexity, O(1).
