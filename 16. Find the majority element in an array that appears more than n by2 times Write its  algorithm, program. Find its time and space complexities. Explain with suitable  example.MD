## ‚úÖ Problem Statement

Given an array of size `n`, find the **majority element** (i.e., the element that appears more than `n / 2` times). It is guaranteed that such an element exists.

## üß† Algorithm (Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm)

The **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm** is an efficient algorithm to solve the majority element problem. It works in two phases:

1. **Phase 1: Candidate Selection**:
   - Start with a `candidate` and a `count` initialized to 0.
   - Traverse the array:
     - If `count` is 0, set the `candidate` to the current element and set `count = 1`.
     - If the current element is equal to `candidate`, increment `count` by 1.
     - If the current element is not equal to `candidate`, decrement `count` by 1.
   - After this phase, the `candidate` will be the majority element (if it exists).

2. **Phase 2: Verification** (optional in some cases):
   - If you want to verify the majority element, traverse the array again and count how many times the `candidate` appears.
   - If it appears more than `n / 2` times, it's the majority element.

## üíª Java Program

```java
public class MajorityElement {

    public static int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int candidate = -1, count = 0;

        // Phase 1: Find the candidate
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (count == 0) {
                candidate = num;
                count = 1;
            } else if (num == candidate) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count--;
            }
        }

        // Phase 2: Verify the candidate (optional, since the problem guarantees the majority element)
        int occurrences = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == candidate) {
                occurrences++;
            }
        }

        return occurrences > nums.length / 2 ? candidate : -1;  // Return -1 if no majority element exists
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {3, 2, 3};
        System.out.println("Majority Element: " + majorityElement(nums));
    }
}
```

## üìå Example

### Input:
```
nums = [3, 2, 3]
```

### Process:
1. **Phase 1: Candidate Selection**
   - Start with `candidate = -1`, `count = 0`.
   - Traverse through the array:
     - At element `3`: `count = 0`, so set `candidate = 3`, `count = 1`.
     - At element `2`: `count != 0`, `candidate = 3`, so decrement `count` to 0.
     - At element `3`: `count = 0`, so set `candidate = 3`, `count = 1`.
   - After Phase 1, the `candidate` is `3`.

2. **Phase 2: Verification (optional)**
   - Count occurrences of `3`: It appears 2 times in the array, which is more than `n / 2` (3 / 2 = 1.5). So, the majority element is `3`.

### ‚úÖ Output:
```
Majority Element: 3
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

| Operation            | Complexity     |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Time                 | O(n)           |
| Space                | O(1)           |

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. We only traverse the array twice (once for candidate selection and once for verification).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we only use a constant amount of extra space for the candidate and count variables.

---

## üìö Summary

The **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm** is an optimal solution to the majority element problem, with a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1). It works by maintaining a `candidate` and a `count` to efficiently find the majority element in a single pass through the array. This approach is widely used in problems where we need to find an element that occurs frequently in a sequence.
