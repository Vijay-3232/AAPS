## ‚úÖ Problem Statement

Given an array representing the heights of bars in a histogram, calculate how much **water** can be trapped between the bars after it rains. The width of each bar is 1 unit.

---

## üß† Algorithm (Two-pointer Approach)

### Key Insight:
The amount of water that can be trapped above a bar depends on the minimum of the maximum heights of the bars to its left and right. If we know the maximum height to the left and right of each bar, we can easily calculate the amount of water trapped above it.

### Steps:
1. **Two pointers**:
   - Start with two pointers: one at the leftmost bar (`left`) and one at the rightmost bar (`right`).
   - Maintain two variables, `leftMax` and `rightMax`, which store the maximum heights encountered so far from the left and the right, respectively.
   
2. **Move the pointers towards the center**:
   - If the height at the `left` pointer is less than the height at the `right` pointer, calculate the water trapped at the `left` pointer:
     - If `height[left]` is greater than or equal to `leftMax`, update `leftMax` with `height[left]`.
     - Otherwise, water can be trapped at `height[left]`, and the amount of trapped water is `leftMax - height[left]`.
   - If the height at the `right` pointer is less than or equal to the height at the `left` pointer, calculate the water trapped at the `right` pointer:
     - If `height[right]` is greater than or equal to `rightMax`, update `rightMax` with `height[right]`.
     - Otherwise, water can be trapped at `height[right]`, and the amount of trapped water is `rightMax - height[right]`.
   
3. **Continue moving the pointers** until they meet.

4. **Return the total amount of trapped water**.

## üíª Java Program

```java
public class TrappingRainWater {

    public static int trap(int[] height) {
        if (height == null || height.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0;
        int totalWater = 0;

        while (left <= right) {
            if (height[left] <= height[right]) {
                if (height[left] >= leftMax) {
                    leftMax = height[left];
                } else {
                    totalWater += leftMax - height[left];
                }
                left++;
            } else {
                if (height[right] >= rightMax) {
                    rightMax = height[right];
                } else {
                    totalWater += rightMax - height[right];
                }
                right--;
            }
        }

        return totalWater;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] height = {0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1};
        System.out.println("Total trapped water: " + trap(height));
    }
}
```

## üìå Example

### Input:
```
height = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
```

### Process:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `left = 0`, `right = 11`, `leftMax = 0`, `rightMax = 0`, `totalWater = 0`.
   
2. **Step-by-step traversal**:
   - Move `left` pointer: At `height[0]`, `height[left] = 0`, no water trapped (since `leftMax = 0`).
   - Move `left` pointer: At `height[1]`, `height[left] = 1`, update `leftMax = 1`, no water trapped.
   - Move `left` pointer: At `height[2]`, `height[left] = 0`, water trapped = `1 - 0 = 1`, `totalWater = 1`.
   - Move `left` pointer: At `height[3]`, `height[left] = 2`, update `leftMax = 2`, no water trapped.
   - Move `left` pointer: At `height[4]`, `height[left] = 1`, water trapped = `2 - 1 = 1`, `totalWater = 2`.
   - Move `left` pointer: At `height[5]`, `height[left] = 0`, water trapped = `2 - 0 = 2`, `totalWater = 4`.
   - Continue similarly until all bars are processed.
   
3. **Final total trapped water**: `totalWater = 6`.

### ‚úÖ Output:
```
Total trapped water: 6
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

| Operation            | Complexity     |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Time                 | O(n)           |
| Space                | O(1)           |

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. We traverse the array only once using two pointers.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we only use a constant amount of extra space for the `leftMax`, `rightMax`, and `totalWater` variables.

---

## üìö Summary

The **Two-pointer Approach** to solve the Trapping Rain Water problem is efficient with a time complexity of **O(n)** and a space complexity of **O(1)**. By maintaining two pointers (one at the leftmost bar and one at the rightmost bar), and keeping track of the maximum heights from both sides, we can calculate the amount of trapped water efficiently without requiring extra space for storing intermediate results.

This approach is optimal and widely used in problems involving histograms, elevation maps, and similar structures.
